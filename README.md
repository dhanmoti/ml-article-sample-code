# ML Article Sample Code

This repository contains sample machine learning code used in my technical articles. The goal is to demonstrate practical implementations of ML models and their deployment in real-world applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview
This repository will be updated with code snippets from various articles covering:
- **Supervised Learning** (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- **Unsupervised Learning** (Clustering, Anomaly Detection, etc.)
- **API Deployment** (Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
- **Model Optimization**
